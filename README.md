# node-red-signalk-flows
My nod-red flows for use with SignalK

## ControlDisplay.json
This flow controls display brightness and color for my display using ddcutil. Other displays may work differently or use other adresses. Just use the tool to inspect what is what. ddcui can help to easily try out what would work for a display.
